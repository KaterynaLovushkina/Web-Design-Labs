Here you can see  React single trip page with next functionality:
Home page: “View more” button should display more elements on the same page Tip: Elements can be just random paragraph & heading, use your imagination ;)
Catalog page: You should be able to filter your items list, by applying different filters by item's properties (i.e size/color/type)
Catalog page: Search by any text property option should also work
Catalog & Item pages: “View more” action on every item should refer to corresponding Item page, with correct information about item (get the info from your state/context)
